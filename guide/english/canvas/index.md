## HTML5 Canvas

Canvas is a technology introduced in HTML5 which can be accessed by the `<canvas>` tag. It allows graphics to be drawn via Javascript, and is a powerful tool for interactivity on the web.

## Usage

Canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with _height_ & _width_ attributes. Javascript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to those of other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics.
Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition.
